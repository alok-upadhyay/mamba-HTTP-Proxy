# mamba - HTTP Proxy  

## An HTTP Proxy similar to the squid-proxy, written in Python.

**Why "mamba"?** 
Well, I was looking for creature similar to squid, but couldn't find any. So, I named it after a snake which used to fascinate me the most in my childhood, the Black Mamba. Another reason could be that it is being written in Python and deserves a name equally lethal, if not more.<br/>

**Features:**
* Will be able to cache the web-content which is being frequently used by the clients. <br/>
* Will be able to provide the administrators with cache-control and also control over the content going through the HTTP Proxy. <br/>
* Will support load balancing using both a round robin and a random director to provide a good user experience for the clients. <br/>
* Will be fully compliant with RFC 2616 (HTTP 1.1), as opposed to squid(which is only partially compliant with HTTP 1.1). <br/>

**Usage**

1. First Install the app on your phone.<br/>
2. Go to the app, configure it by setting the email you would want to send the mail to and the secret-key for triggering this option.<br/>
3. Now, if you lose your phone:<br/>
	Send the message to the lost phone in this format:<br/>
		"resQ secret_key"
